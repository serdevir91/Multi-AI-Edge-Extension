# Privacy Policy for Multi-AI Edge Extension

**Last Updated:** February 12, 2026

## 1. Introduction
Multi-AI Edge Extension ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension collects, uses, and discloses your information.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage
**Multi-AI Edge Extension does NOT collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.**

*   **Local Storage:** All user preferences, chat history, and API keys are stored locally on your device using the browser's `chrome.storage.local` API. This data never leaves your browser.
*   **AI Providers:** When you send a message, the text and any attached images are sent directly from your browser to the AI provider you have selected (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI, Groq). This communication happens directly between your browser and the AI service provider's API. We do not act as an intermediary and do not have access to these messages.

## 3. Permissions
The extension requests the following permissions for specific functions:
*   **ActiveTab / Tabs:** To access the title and URL of the current tab only when you explicitly ask the AI about the page or take a screenshot.
*   **Scripting:** To capture screenshots of the visible area of the active tab upon your request.
*   **Storage / UnlimitedStorage:** To save your chat history and settings locally.
*   **SidePanel:** To display the chat interface.

## 4. Third-Party Services
This extension interacts with third-party AI providers (Google Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) based on your selection. Please review their respective privacy policies to understand how they handle your data:
*   [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
*   [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy)
